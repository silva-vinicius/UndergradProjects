This zip file was generated automatically by exporting the project as an archive using Eclipse IDE.
It includes:

*src folder: The folder that contains the source code files of the system. 
		     This folder contains 3 sub-folders: 'main', 'model' and 'xml', which represent the java packages used in the implementation. 
		     The 2 programs developed as a solution of the coursework are Program1.java and Program2.java, which are inside the 'main' sub-folder.
		     Program3.java is just a tool to generate input for Program1.java. It writes on InputData.dat, which is read by Program1.
		     
*lib folder: The folder that contains the JDOM library, used to handle XML files in this coursework.

*InputData.dat: The source of the data used as input for the system. It is written by Program3 and read by Program1.

*XMLOutput.xml: An XML file generated by Program1 using the data provided in "InputData.dat". 

*Report.txt: A text file that describes in plain English the data stored on "XMLOutput.xml". 		     
             This file was generated by Program2 and is considered the output of the system.
             
             
Obs.: The correct order to run the 3 programs is: Program3, Program1, Program2.
      It happens because Program3 generates the data used as input for Program1 and Program1 generates the data used as input for Program2.
